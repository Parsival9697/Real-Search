Python driven app that will monitor Zillow for houses/properties that match the user's criteria

Please note that this is not a functioning app at this point in time. Despite the countless hours I spent on this project I was unable to crack Zillow's CAPTCHA and allow my bot to sneak in. It is still a work in progress and I will continue to persevere until I can make it to their page with the bot.
